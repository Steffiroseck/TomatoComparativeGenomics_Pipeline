For executing the script, Follow the steps below;

1. Download the pipeline script
git clone https://github.com/Steffiroseck/TomatoComparativeGenomics_Pipeline.git or you can download the zip folder from the github link https://github.com/Steffiroseck/TomatoComparativeGenomics_Pipeline 

2. Go to the downloaded folder. Unzip the folder if you have downloaded the zipped file. Otherwise enter the pipeline folder by typing
cd TomatoComparativeGenomics_Pipeline/

3. Now open the comparative_genomics_pipeline_v2.sh script in any text editor edit the following variables;
  wd - enter the working directory path
  In lines 7 to 14, enter the exact path to the tools 
  Lines 36 to 45, add exact paths to genome and protein fasta files of the species. Make sure that, the correct species paths are added to the correct variables.
    For example, variable lycopersicum should contain lycopersicum genome only.
4. Now copy the initial GFF file for the species under the study (here, it is S. chilense) to the working directory folder ($wd). The GFF file should contain the gene IDs, and their Gene Ontology IDS with descriptions of the GO terms.
5. Save the file.
6. Execute the script
    ./comparative_genomics_pipeline_v2.sh
              or
    bash comparative_genomics_pipeline_v2.sh
7. This will create a directory named "Results" in the current working directory ($wd).
8. After that, it will create sub-directories in the folder Results for each of the comparative analysis. Here,5 sub-folders are created inside Results (chilense_lycopersicum,chilense_lycopersicoides,chilense_pennellii,chilense_pimpinellifolium, and chilense_sitiens)
9. For each of the species comparisons, files are written to the corresponding folders for each species.
